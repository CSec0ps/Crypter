# Crypter

Welcome to Crypter, a ransomware piece written entirely in Python and compiled to Windows executable format using [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/). This README will provide you with all of the information necessary to understand, build and use this software.

**Please note that by making use of this repository you accept and agree with the disclaimer section of this README.**

 ## Disclaimer - IMPORTANT
Crypter is intended for educational and research purposes only. This software should not be used within any system or network for which you do not have permission, nor should it be used for any illegal or illicit purposes. The author takes no responsibility for any damages that may be caused by the software in this repository. 

Once compiled, Crypter WILL encrypt the files on the computer on which it is executed. Whilst this repository provides you with access to the source code of Crypter (enabling you to decrypt any encrypted files), bugs and other issues could, in theory, interrupt or prevent a successful decryption. 

Consequently, a permanent and irreversible loss of data could occur. To avoid any potential damage, you should only run Crypter on a test machine created for this purpose.

Once again, **the author accepts no responsibility for any damages that may occur, and by downloading this software you automatically accept and agree to this disclaimer.**
